                            Unified by the concept of consciously experiencing reality unfettered by imposed biological limitations, we exist to explore artistic renderings of different perceptions and realities.

                            We present creative perspectives based on concepts and mediums centered around biology, technology, coding and absurdism.

                            We are involved in the organization of events focused around the showcasing of artists and music, notably Algoraves, an event where experimental music is created through live computer coding and the process is put on display live.

                            We work with peer collectives such as NBCode (NotBinaryCode) and create exhibitions that explore the intersections of science and art by using technological methods to achieve the final artistic piece.

                            We also release works of emerging artists who share our vision of experimental exploration and futuristic creativity.
